# Library Book Finder (Binary Search – Recursive)

A Python-based library record search tool that locates a book title using the Binary Search algorithm with recursion.
Built for DSA practice but structured like a proper mini-project — modular and easy to read.

## 📌 Features

Reads book titles from external file books.txt

Case-insensitive book search

Binary Search (Recursive)

Displays book position if found

Simple CLI menu-style prompt

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
✅ Binary Search (Recursive)

Concept: Divide search range in half repeatedly

Best/Average Time Complexity: O(log n)

Worst Case: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(log n) (recursion)

📎 Important: Book list must be sorted alphabetically, otherwise binary search will fail.
