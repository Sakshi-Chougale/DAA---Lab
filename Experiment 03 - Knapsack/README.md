# 📦 Project Resource Allocation System  
A Python application demonstrating the **Knapsack Problem (Greedy Method)** for optimal project resource allocation.

---

## 📋 Project Description  
Organizations often face limited resources and must choose projects that yield maximum profit.  
This system uses a **Greedy Knapsack approach** by selecting projects based on the highest **profit-to-resource ratio**, helping maximize total return within constraints.

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Greedy algorithm based on profit/resource ratio  
- Maximizes profit under resource limitations  
- Easy project addition and management  
- Resource utilization analysis with summary output
